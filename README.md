## STEP 1: Problem definition

### Business context
- **Company:** MediCare Solution
- **Department:** Healthcare Technology
- **Location:** Kigali-Rwanda
- **Industry:** healthcare industry.

### Data challenge
The company needs to:
- Analyze patient treatment data
- track medical supply usage
- segment patients for targeted care programs

### Expected outcome
Provide insights into:
- Patient visit frequency 
- Top diagnoses per department
- Trends in treatment outcomes
- Patient segmentation based on visit or billing history

---

## STEP 2: Success criteria
1. **Top 5 patients per region/quarter** - using `RANK()`.
2. **Running monthly totals of medical supply usage** - using `SUM() OVER()`.
3. **Month over month growth in treatment usage** - using `LAG()/LEAD()`.
4. **Segment patients into quartiles** - using `NTILE(4)`.
5. **3-month moving averages of treatment quantities per region** - using `AVG() OVER()`.

## STEP 3: Database schema

### Tables

| Table Name     | Purpose                                         | Key Columns                                    | Example Row                                     |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Patients**   | Store patient personal details                  | PatientID (PK), Name, DOB, Gender, Contact     | 101, "Alice Smith", 1990-05-12, F, "0781234567" |
| **Treatments** | Store available treatments/medications          | TreatmentID (PK), Name                         | 201, "Antibiotic A"                             |
| **Usage**      | Track which patient used which treatment        | UsageID (PK), PatientID (FK), TreatmentID (FK) | 301, 101, 201                                   |
| **Suppliers**  | Store details of suppliers providing treatments | SupplierID (PK), Name, Contact                 | 401, "HealthPharma Ltd", "0789876543"           |
| **Staff**      | Store information about hospital staff          | StaffID (PK), Name, Role                       | 501, "Dr. John Doe", "Pharmacist"               |

### Ranking

**Interpretation:** This query identifies the top patients by treatment costs. It helps administrators see who contributes the most financially and could guide patient prioritization or targeted healthcare programs.

### Aggregate

**Interpretation:** This calculates how much a patient’s expenses are growing over time (running total), plus their average, cheapest, and most expensive treatments. It helps in monitoring treatment trends and controlling healthcare costs.

### Navigation

**Interpretation:** This shows how each patient’s treatment costs change compared to their past visits. For example, a big increase could suggest more complex treatments or worsening conditions. It supports patient progress tracking and medical decision-making.

### Distribution

![Distribution Example](Screenshots/Distribution1.png)

**Interpretation:** This divides patients into 4 groups based on total treatment spending. Hospitals can use this to identify high-cost patients (quartile 1) and design cost-reduction strategies or patient support programs for those in lower quartiles.

## STEP 6: Results Analysis

**1.Descriptive - What happened?**

From the data, we saw that patient visits are highest in January–March, showing the flu season effect. Antibiotics are prescribed more than other treatments, a few patients take much more medicine than average, and some suppliers are often late in delivering medicines.

**2.Diagnostic - Why?**

The rise in visits is because more people get sick in the cold season. Antibiotics are used so much either because doctors prescribe them too often or patients ask for them. The high medicine use for some patients could be because of chronic illnesses or misuse. Suppliers are late because we rely on only a few, and logistics can be tricky.

**3.Prescriptive - What next?**

To fix this, hospitals should monitor antibiotic prescriptions better, work with more reliable suppliers, and balance staff workloads. It also helps to prepare medicine stock before flu season and educate patients so they don’t come in unnecessarily.
